# Image Generation for E-commerce

This repository contains scripts to generate high-quality product images and virtual try-on experiences using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other generative AI models.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-generation-ecommerce.git
    cd image-generation-ecommerce
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install torch torchvision opencv-python
    ```

3. Download the pretrained models and place them in the appropriate paths:
    - `product_image_augmentation.py`: Place the GAN model at `path/to/pretrained_gan.pth`.
    - `virtual_tryon.py`: Place the Virtual Try-On model at `path/to/virtual_tryon_model.pth`.

## Usage

### Product Image Augmentation

1. Run the `product_image_augmentation.py` script to generate augmented product images:
    ```bash
    python product_image_augmentation.py
    ```

2. Edit the script to use your own product image path:
    ```python
    image_path = 'path/to/your_product_image.jpg'
    ```

### Virtual Try-On Experience

1. Run the `virtual_tryon.py` script to generate a virtual try-on experience:
    ```bash
    python virtual_tryon.py
    ```

2. Edit the script to use your own product and user image paths:
    ```python
    product_image_path = 'path/to/your_product_image.jpg'
    user_image_path = 'path/to/your_user_image.jpg'
    ```
